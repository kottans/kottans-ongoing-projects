# Kottans: the ongoing projects

This repo is dedicated to tracking
+ ongoing proposals from fellow kottans or just regular bystander about any kind of improvements
+ progress and links to other parts of Kottans' Magic Land™ in which courses, events, fun/useful projects are brewed
+ list of collaborators/contributors and projects/events that we want to emphasize

## How to make sense of things?

You can just go straight to the [big list of things](https://github.com/kottans/kottans-ongoing-projects/issues). Issues (or proposals) there might be using tags to indicate type of issue.

If you have something you want to sure – create a proposal. If you see proposal you can help with – leave a comment and collaborate.

### Type of Item

Proposal item might be generally classified into:
+ [Kottans Course](https://github.com/kottans/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/kottans%20course). This would include proposal to run (new) course in (some/new) city.
+ [Kottans Event](https://github.com/kottans/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/kottans%20event). Event under Kottans™ umbrella. Kottans hackathon, workshop, meetup, etc. Kottans should be invited, but event shouldn't be restricting to be kottans-exclusive (yet it may).
+ [Other event](https://github.com/kottans/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/other%20event). Yet it has to do something with open-source, charity and or other areas that kottans might be interested to help with.
+ [Kottans Improvement](https://github.com/kottans/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/kottans%20improvement). Has to deal with something regarding our tools, workflow, chores, etc. 'Work on Site', 'Post on dou.ua', 'Print and distribute stickers' might be labeled under this.
+ [Kottans Project](https://github.com/kottans/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/kottans%20project). Deals with things kottans build for greater good, yet our own. 'Create tool for registration', 'create automated tests for all Ruby homeworks', etc.
+ [Other Project](https://github.com/kottans/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/other%20project). Invite kottans to hack on something, preferably open-source and something you are not making money off.

### Proposal Format

So, typical issue should contain:
  1. Subject (short sentence describing initiative).
  2. Term/duration (when is it going to take place or how long it might last).
  3. Keywords:
    + Online/offline
    + City
    + Technologies
  4. What do we propose and what do we need to reach the goal?
Consider adding 'due date', 'qty of people needed', 'skills needed' fields.
